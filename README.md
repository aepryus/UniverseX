# UniverseX

The following is a set of links to video's discussing Universe X.

In order to not make perfect the enemy of good (or in the case perfect the enemy of very bad) I want to create provisional versions of each of the videos I intend, discussing various aspects of Universe X.

Over time I will be able to polish the videos one by one (perhaps multiple times) but use this repository as a an index to the current structure and best version of each video.
